Lockbox vs Completion Accounts - M&A Mechanism Chooser

Welcome, deal warriors and spreadsheet jockeys.

This Streamlit app helps you quickly decide whether to use a Lockbox or Completion Accounts structure in your next thrilling M&A transaction.
*(Or at least make it look like you know what youâ€™re doing.)*

### Features

- Simple sliders to input real-world factors like company stability, seller trustworthiness, cashflow volatility, and how much you enjoy chaos.
- Instant recommendation based on a scrappy little scoring system that pretends to be scientific.
- Streamlit-powered beauty â€” yes, it even works on mobile when youâ€™re panicking on a conference call.

### How It Works

1. Adjust the sliders based on your deal's characteristics.
2. Click the "Score My Deal!" button.
3. Get a smug recommendation - Lockbox if you trust people, Completion Accounts if you don't (spoiler: you probably don't).

### Requirements

Just one thing:

```shell
streamlit>=1.32.0
```
### Deployment

Clone this repo and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run lockbox_completion.py
```

Or deploy directly via Streamlit Community Cloud if you enjoy magic.

## Warning

This app is:

- Not legal advice.
- Not financial advice.
- Definitely not responsible for your career choices.
- Absolutely better than flipping a coin.
